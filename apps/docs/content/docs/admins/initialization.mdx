The LMS only accepts one school per installation. Once it has been initialized you can't initialize it again. We will be using `example.com` as our dummy domain name throught this docs.

To initialize the LMS you need to go to [https://example.com/initialization](https://example.com/initialization
). Here we got two tabs, for your details and school details. You'll need to enter your information and only
school name. This makes it easier to quickly initialize the system then tweak the school settings and other
information later in the settings.

Once the system has already been initialized this route will not be accessible and will always redirect to
the root of your domain, ([https://example.com](https://example.com)) with the error message `LMS already
initialized`.
