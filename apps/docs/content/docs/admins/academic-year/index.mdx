## Whats an Academic Year?

Academic year is a reference to full academic period after which learners move to the next stage (academic
year) or finish their education. Whats a better way to explain this than by examples.

## Examples of Academic Years Implementations

### A primary or high school where students take several years

Under this context an academic year if a full year of learning before students gets promoted to the next class.
You can have academic years like `Academic Year 2025` which starts at the beginning to the end of the year. If
your time schedule runs inter-yearly say June this year to June next year, it can be `Academic Year 2025 - 2026
`

You will need to create academic years for each time the students get promoted forward to the next class then choose what students gets to go to the next class the following academic year.

### A learning platform with one time courses

If your courses span multiple years and students get promoted to the next class then you'll also need multiple
academic years like in the first example.

If you have one off courses like say a programming bootcamp then this option is for you. You will need to
create academic years for each time you start a new learning period. For example you can have `Cohort 1` start
January till June after which the students graduate then you have another intake for the next batch of
students who can belong to say `Cohort 2`.
