Luzin uses an advanced calendar system to handle all events in the system. Any activity that takes place is an event from a class schedule, to exams, meetings or school events like thanksgiving ceremony.

### Creating Events

To create an event you'll need to give event information like name, an optional description and an optional
location. The next important thing an event need is the scope, scope determines the target audience for the
event e.g the whole school, a class or small group of people.

#### Types of Scopes

- **Global scope**:- This targets the whole institution, all users in the system will get the event in their
calendar. Use this for general school events like closing ceremony. This won't target school alumni's like
past teachers or students.

- **Academic Year Scope**:- This will target all students who are in the current academic year no matter their
class. It's a way to create a students only event for example a debate. You will need to select an academic
year for the event if you use this scope.

- **Class Scope**: This targets only students in a particular class for example Grade 1 of Academic Year 2025.
Generally used for in class events like class timetable. You will need to select a class for this event if you
choose this scope.

- **Targeted Scope**: This allows you to control who exactly is invited. You will need to add each user
individually to the event from the dashboard. Used for small private events like a meeting for system admins.

### Event Type

This is used to give extra information to the user viewing the event and has no functionality tied to it. You
will need to pick a type for the event when creating it. Luzin currently supports 5 types and one for just
custom events. All event type are listed below.

- Lesson
