description: Timing schedules for events and events recurrences
---

To standardize how we handle event timings and recurring events like timetable events for classes our timings
need values, a recurrence rule for the event and a duration for the event. Recurrence rule tells the events
how its supposed to repeat itself and at what time it needs to start while duration tell the event how long
the event will take any time it occurs.

You can read more about recurrence rules [here](). The duration needs to be a time in any of the 3 formats
below:

- `hh:mm:ss.sss`: Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Milliseconds
- `hh:mm:ss`: Hours, Minutes, Seconds
- `hh:mm`: Hours, Minutes
