title: Getting Started
description: Inviting other users to the platform
---

When initializing you get the role of `admin` which gives you the authority to invite any other user to the LMS. All other users can only join the system through invites unless you particularly allow public signups.

### Public signups

All users that signup to the platform publicly will get the role of `student`. We currently support 3 roles:

- `admin`: Has full system priviledges
- `teacher`: Has control over classes, students, and related activities
- `student`: Has no control over the system

### Inviting Users

You can invite users from the admin panel under the invites tab. An admin can invite other `admins`, `teachers
` or `students`. When inviting students, you will need to specify what academic year they are going to join
when they signup. Invites are sent to users to their email. You'll need the users email, role and academic
year incase of students.


You also will need to also specify the expiry date of the invite after which the users invite link won't be
accepted. You can easily revoke an invite from the dashboard for invites that were sent to the wrong users to
prevent unauthorized access.

### Whats Coming

We are working on link based invite system in addition to sending emails, where you can share a link and users
can use that link to signup to the system. This form of invite will only work for students and NOT admins or
teachers.
